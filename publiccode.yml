    shortDescription: XML Schema validator and data conversion library for Python
    longDescription: >
      The _xmlschema_ library is an implementation of [XML
      Schema](http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema) for Python (supports Python 3.5+).


      This library arises from the needs of a solid Python layer for processing
      XML Schema based files for [MaX (Materials design at the
      Exascale)](http://www.max-centre.eu/)  European project. A significant
      problem is the encoding and the decoding of the XML data files produced by
      different simulation software. Another important requirement is the XML
      data validation, in order to put the produced data under control. The lack
      of a suitable alternative for Python in the schema-based decoding of XML
      data has led to build this library. Obviously this library can be useful
      for other cases related to XML Schema based processing, not only for the
      original scope.
    features:
      - XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1 validator and decoder
